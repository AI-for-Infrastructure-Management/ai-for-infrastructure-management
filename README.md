# IMP-act Challenge
Shaping tomorrow's infrastructure landscape

---

## Can AI-based approaches reliably maintain real-world road networks?

Answering this question can lead to drastic reductions in:

- Maintenance costs üí∞
- Carbon emissions ‚ôªÔ∏è
- Traffic delays ‚è≥

---

## Competition

Our competition aims to harness **AI capabilities** to tackle the complexities of infrastructure **inspection and maintenance planning**.

Participants will be tasked with developing innovative methodologies, such as **deep reinforcement learning** algorithms, to optimize inspection schedules, identify maintenance needs, and ensure the safety and efficiency of a **real-world road network**.
