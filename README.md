# IMP-act Challenge
Shaping tomorrow‚Äôs infrastructure landscape

Did you know that‚Ä¶?
- The extraction, transport, and processing of key materials of the built environment account for 15% of carbon emissions.
- Transport infrastructure holds 7.5% of carbon emissions related to materials.
- Most of the world‚Äôs infrastructure is approaching or has exceeded its design life.¬†
- Better transportation networks, e.g., in terms of road quality, safety, and congestion, are shown to increase the quality of life and economic competitiveness.

## Why is this challenge important? 
We are trying to understand how AI can help support more sustainable, safe, and cost-effective (road) infrastructure systems. By investigating the following points:

- How can we dynamically and optimally allocate resources for up-keeping infrastructure segments.
- How can we reduce traffic delays and accidents due to poor road conditions.
- How can we improve accessibility to critical network nodes (such as hospitals, metro stations, etc.).
- How can we limit emissions from traffic and road maintenance by ensuring longer lifetimes and reduced road closures.
- How can we improve road safety and overall user experience by keeping roads in good condition.
- How can we learn intervention policies that are transferable across various infrastructure asset types.
    
Answering these questions can lead to drastic reductions in:
- Maintenance costs üí∞
- Carbon emissions ‚ôªÔ∏è
- Traffic delays ‚è≥

## Competition

The goal of the competition is to push the boundaries of AI-driven solutions for identifying multi-year inspection and maintenance plans for real-world infrastructure systems, with particular emphasis in this cycle on road transportation networks. Provided road network environments will be analyzed, towards minimizing inspection and maintenance costs, associated traffic delays, emissions, and driving risks.

Challenges for planning in this context arise from:
- Multiple uncertainties, related to physical degradation mechanisms, data collection methods, effects of intervention actions, and network parameters.
- The many components comprising the network, with state and action combinations scaling exponentially with the number of components.
- The length of the planning horizon, which makes possible decision paths to scale exponentially with the number of steps.
- The coordination and traffic complexities, related to spatial and topological characteristics of the network.
- The presence of deterministic and/or probabilistic constraints, related to limited resources and risk thresholds.

## Simulation Environment
The challenge provides a software package to simulate the degradation process of several highway networks at a road segment level. The simulator considers the effect of possible inspection and maintenance actions over a lifetime of 50 years. A number of realistic traffic scenarios are also included, which are naturally influenced by the maintenance actions on the network. The goal is to find an inspection and maintenance policy that can minimize life-cycle costs and average travel time in the network while operating under budgetary constraints.¬†
